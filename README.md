# TestProject
This is a one of my practice projects that uses different Android features, like Recycler View, Actions of the Action Bar, Marshmallow
Permissions, etc.

This app enables the user to naviagte between different tabs. The first tab, has a recycler view with tewo different layouts, and the user
can shuffle between the layouts with an action button. Access to the features of the second tab requires camera permissions to be enabled.
